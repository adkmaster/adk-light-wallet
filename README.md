This is a Lightweight ADK Wallet

You can use this wallet to query and view addresses and their balances for a given seed. The site uses only local JS files and uses the ADK.JS library to perform operations.

You can also use this tool to send ADK, and it allows you to select the specific source addresses that the ADK should be sent from.

Furthermore, this tool allows you to create transaction with SMARTDATA, which can be used for special operations or smart contract interaction (more info to follow)

NOTE: Even though this website only uses local JS files and does not store or load any remote content, please ensure you use this tool only in secure environments (up to date Antivirus, OS, etc).

Use at own risk
